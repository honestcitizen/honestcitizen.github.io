Who I am precisely should not really matter here.

What does though, is that I am a human being just like you and as millions of others I mentally struggle in my daily life. I face difficulties that are invisible to the outter world: anxiety, stress, you name it. This blog is first intended for me as a way of sharing those feelings I deal with but also for you, who if you're reading this are problably in the same situation.

Mental health is still in 2019 a taboo topic. People (including me) feel ashamed and not normal when they realize they are mentally ill. This should not be the case and I want it to change. I encourage everyone to talk about their problems in one way or another. This blog is my modest contribution and hopefully it will help some of you out there.
